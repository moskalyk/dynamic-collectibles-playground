1. simple read and write router for state
2. liquid collectible with evolution (todo)

# brainstorming
## 1. water progression
### lvl 1 -> wallet
- rain -> gravity / synchronicity (increase counter multiplier by slots 12. more claim in same slot, higher counter you get)
- wave -> audio nft (optional) use some seed from rain

### lvl 2 -> rain + wave*A > 100
- freeze -> media nft (optional) use some seed from rain
- evaporate -> burn rain or freeze to pool

### lvl 3 -> rain + wave*A + freeze*B > 300
- extinguish something or snowglobe

## 2. character map progression
- the more POI you travel to, higher points and higher the level
- lvl 0: radio -> listen
- lvl 1: rent bike / scooter
- lvl 2: rent car
- lvl N: <insert_vehicle>

## 3. collectible graffiti
### lvl 1
- browse popular
### lvl 2 (evolve 1->2: # of views / time_w > w_avg)
- post with prompt
- expand horizon
### lvl 3 (evolve 2->3: # of posts / time_x > x_avg)
- browse recent
- upvote
- downvote
### lvl 4 (evolve 3->4: # of votes / time_y > y_avg)
- comment
- mint from others collection
### lvl 5 (evolve 4->5: # of comments / time_z > z_avg)
- follow with notifications
- expiry on posts
  
hypothesis: where n_avg count for live users
hypothesis: live users as recent 30 day as online

#### thoughts
- liquidity vs liquid
- what came first, rain or wave
- can a game accelerate code development
